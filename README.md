# Metabolic-impact-of-sublethal-coal-particle-concentrations-on-a-scleractinian-coral
The proximity of coal mines and ports adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area creates potential for chronic coal dust discharge to enter the reef system. To date, adult corals have not been experimentally exposed to sublethal coal dust (< 30 mg L-1), and the concentrations at which metabolic impairment occurs remains unknown. Here, we quantify the effects of sublethal coal concentrations (0-100 mg L-1) after 40-days exposure on the physiological functioning of the coral, Caulastrea furcata. Our results reveal photosynthetic impairment and depletion of energy reserves at coal concentrations >17 mg L-1. Untargeted metabolomes and elementomes revealed lower abundances of storage compounds, and algal symbiont uptake and bioaccumulation of trace elements (Mg, Al, S, Ca, Sc, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Zr, Ag, Pb, U), shaping metabolic function. Exposure to chronic sublethal coal concentrations as low as 17 mg L-1 impacts the energy metabolism of C. furcata, providing managers with the first biologically relevant effect threshold of coal concentrations.
