# Metabolic-impact-of-sublethal-coal-particle-concentrations-on-a-scleractinian-coral
The proximity of coal mines and ports to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area creates potential for chronic coal dust discharge to enter the reef system. To date, adult corals have not been experimentally exposed to sublethal coal dust (< 30 mg L-1), and the concentrations at which metabolic impairment occurs remains unknown. Here, we quantify the effects of sublethal coal concentrations (0-124 mg L-1) after 40-days exposure on the physiological functioning of the coral, Caulastrea furcata. Our results reveal that photosynthetic impairment occurred at coal concentrations >20 mg L-1 and depletion of energy reserves at >17 mg L-1. Untargeted analysis of the coral metabolome and elementome revealed lower abundances of storage compounds, and algal symbiont uptake and bioaccumulation of trace elements (Mg, Al, S, Ca, Sc, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Zr, Ag, Pb, U), shaping metabolic function. Lastly, exposure to coal concentrations as low as ~5 mg L-1 negatively impacts the calcification and respiration of C. furcata, providing managers with the first biologically relevant effect threshold of chronic coal exposures.
